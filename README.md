## 90 Days Challenge — A Reality Check

I took up this challenge with excitement, but job tension, stress, and distractions pulled me off track.

This failure taught me something important:
👉 discipline > motivation  
👉 consistency > intensity  

I’m not quitting. I’m recalibrating.

The journey continues. 🔥
